**Scrolless** is an open-source Android application designed to help users avoid excessive consumption of brain rot by blocking distracting content like Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts. Using Android's accessibility permissions, the app detects and blocks this type of content whenever it appears on the screen.
Since the app requires accessibility permissions, which are significant for user privacy, Scrolless is fully open-source.
